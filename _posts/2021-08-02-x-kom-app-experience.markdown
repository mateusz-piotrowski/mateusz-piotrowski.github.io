Hi all,

The [<b>x-kom</b>](https://www.x-kom.pl/) is a company that everyone knows.  
Currently, they are one of the biggest retailers of electronic articles in Poland.  

A few weeks ago I looked closer at the mobile application for Android and iOS operating systems.  

I found 2 bugs in both application versions.  
- In the first issue, I can not add the article to the cart when I am not sign in.  
- In the second, not all articles have information about sold amounts.

I sent them the request with the screenshots via e-mail.  

I received only information about the received request,  
and no message about fixed function.  

Life went forward and sometime after sent the request,  
the mobile applications for both operating systems received updates.  

After these updates, they have changed the minimal version of iOS from `12.0` to `13.0`.  
So, now I can't get access via an application from my iPhone 5S,  
but Apple still publishes security updates, so I think this model is still supported.

Also, I do not understand one thing:  
if they do not allow me to have access to the store,  
why they still sent a push notification to me about new promotions?  

It is everything that I have for today.  
Everyone is a blacksmith of own fate.
