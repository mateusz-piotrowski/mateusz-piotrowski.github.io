Hi all,

Today I want share with you <a href="https://github.com/mateusz-piotrowski/learn-to-program">execises results</a> which I made during reading the following book:  
<a href="https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram">Learn to program</a>.

The author choosed the <strong>Ruby</strong> programming language to introduce reader to programming world.  
In my opinion he made a great job.

During reading this book you will start from the basics as variables,  
next via loops you will get to class and methods.

It is everything that I have for today.  
Everyone is a blacksmith of own fate.  
Mateusz.
