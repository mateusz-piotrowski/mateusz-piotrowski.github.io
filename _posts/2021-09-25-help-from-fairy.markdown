Hi all,

Each of us (**developers**) has been met it - a bug causes an issue.  

When we developing an application from scratch we are in a *comfortable* situation,  
we will be able to reproduce a bug and fix it quickly.  
Also we could leaved some comments in code, notes on the computer  
or our brain will make retrospection  
and we know what is the business case to solve.

The situation is harder when we joined the **legacy** project.  
If in the team is person or are people who are in it from the beginning,  
they could help us understand the logic, but if they left the company  
and they made technologic debt we are alone.

The only positive in that situation is when at the business side,  
we will meet a person who describes to us what the application or system should do.  

But when the situation is hopeless and even reverse engineering don't give results,  
we could run the [**fairy**](https://www.github.com/mateusz-piotrowski/fairy) app which gives us example causes ; - )  

Currently, it is available in the following versions:
- _**Bash**_
- _**C**_
- _**Python**_

I successively adding new ones - please be patient.  
Also, I inviting you to contribute to this repository.

It is everything that I have for today.  
Everyone is a blacksmith of own fate.  
Mateusz.
