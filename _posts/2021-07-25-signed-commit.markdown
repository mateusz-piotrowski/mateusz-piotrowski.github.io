Hi all,

Some time ago, the <b>Nextcloud</b> released new version of their product.  
I went to repository on the <b>GitHub</b> and looked closer at the counter of commits in the `master` branch.  
This number interesed me and I looked at a few first commits.
Next to general information about the commit, in the little circle button,  
I saw green text: <span style="color: green;">Verified</span>, which inspired me to check what that mean.  

After a fast research, I knew it is information about commit signed using GPG key.  
I followed the manual attached below and my commits are now <font style="color:green;"><span>Verified</span></font>, too.  
[GitHub Manual](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification)

In my opinion it is good practice to signed own commits,  
because during contributioning to public repositories changes made by us will be more trusted.

It is everything that I have for today.  
Everyone is a blacksmith of own fate.
