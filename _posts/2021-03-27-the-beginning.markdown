It was daily standup, like many others in scrum teams.

We were talking about a good solution for some issue.

At the end, we changed the topic and started talking about the future of our team:
* how we can share knowledge between us?
* how we can grow our skills?
* which technologies will be useful in our work which we can learn?

but one of my teammates threw something like that:
> Do you know how learn?

I answered:
> I do not know.

So, he told me about one book which should be good at the beginning:  
[`Apprenticeship Patterns: Guidance for the Aspiring Software Craftsman`](https://www.amazon.com/Apprenticeship-Patterns-Guidance-Aspiring-Craftsman/dp/0596518382).

I bought it after my work.  
This afternoon it was raining and the weather does not encourage to trip bookstore in the city center.  
I started reading this book in the evening on the same day.

After a few days, I finished reading.  
When I writing this post I do not remember everything,  
but one thing was stuck in my memory.  
It is a little advice: `note everything that you learn`.

I decided to back to this book and reads again,  
but before I will do that, I will start writing my own blog.

You can think my idea is so flat.  
What can be hard to write a blog? On the internet are a lot of blogs:  
from cooking, through travels to technology blogs.  
I might be wrong, but in my opinion:  
The thing is not who read your blog, but in that, what it giving for you.

Some do it only for creating fake news and falsify the truth.  
Others for money or other benefits.

I start to do it to develop myself and share knowledge with the community.

It is everything that I have for today.  
Everyone is a blacksmith of own fate.
