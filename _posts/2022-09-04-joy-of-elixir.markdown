Hi all,

Today I want share with you a summary and <a href="https://github.com/mateusz-piotrowski/joy-of-elixir">execises results</a> which I made while reading the following book:  
<a href="https://joyofelixir.com/">Joy of Elixir</a>.

## Discover the "Joy of Elixir": Your First Step into Programming

Ever thought about learning to code but felt intimidated by where to start?  
Or perhaps you've heard whispers of a functional programming language called Elixir and wondered what all the buzz is about? If either of these sounds like you, then Ryan Bigg's "Joy of Elixir" might just be the friendly guide you've been searching for.

Aimed squarely at those with little to no prior programming experience, <a href="https://joyofelixir.com/">Joy of Elixir</a> sets out to make your first foray into the world of coding a delightful and accessible one. As the author himself notes, the book was born out of a desire to provide a truly beginner-friendly resource for learning Elixir, a language known for its scalability and fault tolerance, but which can initially seem daunting.

**So, what exactly is Elixir?** No, it's not just a magical potion (though some of its capabilities might seem like it!). Elixir is a dynamic, functional language built on the Erlang VM (BEAM). It's designed for building scalable and maintainable applications.
But don't let the technical terms scare you - <a href="https://joyofelixir.com/">Joy of Elixir</a> is here to demystify it all.

Let's take a peek at what your learning journey with this book would look like, guided by its inviting chapter titles:

## Part One: Introductions

The book kicks off by answering the fundamental questions:
* **But who is this book for really?** Hint: It's for you, the aspiring programmer!
* **Elixir? Isn’t that something you drink?** A fun way to tackle the very basics and set the tone for an enjoyable learning experience.

## Part Two: And away we go

This is where you'll start getting your hands dirty with the core concepts of Elixir:
* You'll be **"Appeasing the masses with code,"** likely learning how to write your first simple programs.
* Ever wondered, **"Now, where did I put that value?"** This section will introduce you to variables and how Elixir handles data.
* Get ready for **"Lovely lists"** and **"Marvellous maps,"** as you explore fundamental data structures.
* Discover the power of **"Funky functions"** – the building blocks of Elixir applications.
* And prepare to be amazed by **"Pattern matching,"** one of Elixir's most powerful and expressive features.
* A helpful **Recap** ensures you've grasped these foundational elements.

## Part Three: Building on the foundations

With the basics under your belt, Part Three delves deeper into practical programming:
* Learn about **"Working with strings, input and output"** – essential for any interactive program.
* You'll revisit and expand your knowledge of **"Working with lists"** and **"Working with maps."**
* Dive into **"Working with files"** to make your programs interact with the file system.
* Understand **"Conditional code"** to make your programs make decisions.
* Figure out how to keep **"Finding more functions"** by exploring Elixir's rich standard library.
* Get organized with **"Modules and Structs,"** learning how to structure your code effectively.
* Another timely **Recap** helps consolidate your learning.

## Part Four: Real world Elixir

The final part of the book transitions you towards more practical, real-world Elixir development:
* An **"Introduction to Mix"** will acquaint you with Elixir's essential build tool.
* You'll learn about **"Mix dependencies,"** managing external libraries to extend your application's capabilities.
* And critically, you'll be introduced to **"Automated testing,"** a cornerstone of modern software development, ensuring your code works as expected.

<a href="https://joyofelixir.com/">Joy of Elixir</a> is more than just a textbook - it's a companion designed to spark curiosity and build confidence.  
Its focus on a "gentle introduction" and a "fun and enjoyable" approach makes it an excellent choice if you're looking to take your very first steps into the rewarding world of programming, with Elixir as your guide.  
Best of all, you can often find this gem available for free online, making it incredibly accessible to everyone.

So, if you're ready to embark on a new learning adventure and discover the joy of creating with code,
