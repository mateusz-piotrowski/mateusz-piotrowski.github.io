Hi all,

Today I want to share with you <a href="https://github.com/mateusz-piotrowski/joy-of-elixir">execise results</a> which I made while reading the following book:  
<a href="https://joyofelixir.com/">Joy of Elixir</a>.

The author introduces the reader to the <strong>Elixir</strong> programming language.  
The book has been written interestingly.

## Part One: Introductions

- But who is this book for really?
- Elixir? Isn't that something you drink?

## Part Two: And away we go

- Appeasing the masses with code
- Now, where did I put that value?
- Lovely lists
- Marvellous maps
- Funky functions
- Pattern matching
- Part 2: Recap

## Part Three: Building on the foundations

- Working with strings, input and output
- Working with lists
- Working with maps
- Working with files
- Conditional code
- Finding more functions
- Modules and Structs
- Part 3: Recap

## Part Four: Real world Elixir

- Introduction to Mix
- Mix dependencies
- Automated testing

It is everything that I have for today.  
Everyone is a blacksmith of own fate.  
Mateusz.
